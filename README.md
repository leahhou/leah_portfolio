### Then I start to plan the sitemap and content I would like to create on my website
### I screenshot all individual elements I like about from each websites and organise them by their element names in my moodbord folder
### Then I start to draw my website wireframe
### I use Indesign to create a hi-fi version of my design for both website and mobile
### I change and update the hi-fi version until i am happy with the final design for both website and mobile.
### Here are some screenshot to show my design process
